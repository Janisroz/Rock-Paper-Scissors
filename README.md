## Testing

### Testing Strategy

Two methods of testing were implemented throughout the development of this website. The first was continuous testing that was carried out throughout the projects. This was utilized in both the JavaScript and also in the CSS. In the CSS testing was continuously performed in order to ensure all elements were as user friendly as possible and adhered to the design scheme. Continuous testing was especially important in the JavaScript and testing was constantly performed in order to ensure that the logic was being executed correctly and all functions were working how and when they were expected. 

The second method of testing was a more formal approach in which the site was brought through validators and other tools in order to ensure all code was iplemented as efficiently and user friendly as possible.
